* ```IMAGE_PROXY``` : enable the image proxyfication through SearXNG; the built-in image proxy is used (set this to `true`)

* ```GIT_BRANCH``` : set git branch for custom SearXNG repo (for example `main`)

* ```UWSGI_WORKERS``` : set the amount of uwsgi workers (each worker can handle HTTP requests to the server); defaults to the amount of CORS the server has (for example: `4`)

* ```UWSGI_THREADS``` : set the amount of uwsgi threads per worker; so each worker has the amount of threads defined here; defaults to 4 (for example: `4`)
